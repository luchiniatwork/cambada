# Cambada

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/luchiniatwork/cambada.svg)](https://clojars.org/luchiniatwork/cambada)

Cambada is a packager for Clojure based on `deps.edn` (AKA `tools.deps`). It is
heavily inspired by Leiningen's jar and uberjar tasks and also supports
GraalVM's new native-image making it a one-stop shop for any packaging needed
for your Clojure project.

## Motivation

Leiningen has laid the foundations of what many of us have come to accept as the
standard for Clojure projects. Clojure's `tools.deps` potentially brings new
ideas to the Clojure workflow. Cambada brings some of the great features of
Leiningen to the `tools.deps` workflow.

Cambada's sole focus is packaging. It doesn't have plugins, templates or Clojars
integration. It packages your `deps.edn` progject as one - or all - of:

1. jar
2. uberjar
3. GraalVM native image

On top of Phil Hagelberg's (and so many others') great Leiningen, many thanks to
Dominic Monroe and his work on `pack` as well as Taylor Wood and his
`clj.native-image`. These projects offered a lot of inspiration (and, in some
cases, donor code too).

## Getting Started

Cambada is a simple set of main functions that can be called from a `deps.edn`
alias. The simplest way to have it available in your project is to add an alias
with `extra-deps` to your `deps.edn` file:

``` clojure
{:aliases {:cambada
           {:extra-deps
            {luchiniatwork/cambada
             {:mvn/version "1.0.5"}}}}}
```

Cambada has three main entry points, `cambada.jar`, `cambada.uberjar` and
`cambada.native-image`. Let's say you simply want to create an uberjar:

``` shell
$ clj -R:cambada -m cambada.uberjar
Cleaning target
Creating target/classes
  Compiling ...
Creating target/project-name-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Updating pom.xml
Creating target/project-name-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
  Including ...
Done!
```

Your files will be located at `target/` by default.

All entry points have a few extra configuration options you might be interested
in. For instance:

``` shell
$ clj -R:cambada -m cambada.uberjar --help
Package up the project files and all dependencies into a jar file.

Usage: clj -m cambada.uberjar [options]

Options:
  -m, --main NS_NAME                            The namespace with the -main function
      --app-group-id STRING     project-name    Application Maven group ID
      --app-artifact-id STRING  project-name    Application Maven artifact ID
      --app-version STRING      1.0.0-SNAPSHOT  Application version
      --[no-]copy-source                        Copy source files by default
  -a, --aot NS_NAMES            all             Namespaces to be AOT-compiled or `all` (default)
  -d, --deps FILE_PATH          deps.edn        Location of deps.edn file
  -o, --out PATH                target          Output directory
  -h, --help                                    Shows this help
```

Do try `--help` for `cambada.jar` and `cambada.native-image` if you are
interested or refer to the sections below.

## Easy Aliases

One of the powers-in-simplicity of `tools.deps` is the ability to define aliases
on `deps.edn`. When we used the alias `cambada` on the section above, we simply
specified it as an dependency to be resolved (therefore the `-R` when calling
`clj`).

You can also be a lot more prescriptive in your aliases by making them do more
work for you. For instance, the alias below will create a versioned uberjar:

``` clojure
{:aliases {:uberjar
           {:extra-deps
            {luchiniatwork/cambada {:mvn/version "1.0.0"}}
            :main-opts ["-m" "cambada.uberjar"
                        "--app-version" "0.5.3"]}}}
```

By having an alias like this `uberjar` one in your `deps.edn` you can simply run
it by using `$ clj -A:uberjar` making it very familiar to those used with `$
lein uberjar`:

``` shell
$ clj -A:uberjar
Cleaning target
Creating target/classes
  Compiling ...
Creating target/project-name-0.5.3.jar
Updating pom.xml
Creating target/project-name-0.5.3-standalone.jar
  Including ...
Done!
```

## Packaging as a Jar

Let's start with an empty project folder:

``` shell
$ mkdir -p myproj/src/myproj/
$ cd myproj
```

Create a `deps.edn` at the root of your project with `cambada.jar` as an alias:

``` clojure
{:aliases {:jar
           {:extra-deps
            {luchiniatwork/cambada {:mvn/version "1.0.2"}}
            :main-opts ["-m" "cambada.jar"
                        "-m" "myproj.core"]}}}
```

Create a simple hello world on a `-main` function at `src/myproj/core.clj`:

``` clojure
(ns myproj.core
  (:gen-class))

(defn -main [& args]
  (println "Hello World!"))
```

Of course, just for safe measure, let's run this hello world via `clj`:

``` shell
$ clj -m myproj.core
Hello World!
```

Then just call the alias from the project's root:

``` shell
$ clj -A:jar
Cleaning target
Creating target/classes
  Compiling myproj.core
Creating target/myproj-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Updating pom.xml
Done!
```

Once Cambada is done, you'll have a jar package at `target/`. In order to run
it, you'll need to add Clojure and spec to your class path. The paths will vary
on your system:

``` shell
$ java -cp target/myproj-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar myproj.core
Hello World!
```
For a standalone jar file see the uberjar option on the next section.

You can specify the following options for `cambada.jar`:

``` text
  -m, --main NS_NAME                            The namespace with the -main function
      --app-group-id STRING     project-name    Application Maven group ID
      --app-artifact-id STRING  project-name    Application Maven artifact ID
      --app-version STRING      1.0.0-SNAPSHOT  Application version
      --[no-]copy-source                        Copy source files by default
  -a, --aot NS_NAMES            all             Namespaces to be AOT-compiled or `all` (default)
  -d, --deps FILE_PATH          deps.edn        Location of deps.edn file
  -o, --out PATH                target          Output directory
  -h, --help                                    Shows this help
```

These options should be quite self-explanatory and the defaults are
hopefully sensible enough for most of the basic cases. By default
everything gets AOT-compiled and sources are copied to the resulting jar.

For those used to Leiningen, the application's group ID, artifact ID
and version are not extracted from `project.clj` (since it's assumed
you don't have a `project.clj` in a `deps.edn` workflow). Therefore,
you must specify these expressively as options.

## Packaging as an Uberjar

Let's start with an empty project folder:

``` shell
$ mkdir -p myproj/src/myproj/
$ cd myproj
```

Create a `deps.edn` at the root of your project with `cambada.jar` as an alias:

``` clojure
{:aliases {:uberjar
           {:extra-deps
            {luchiniatwork/cambada {:mvn/version "1.0.0"}}
            :main-opts ["-m" "cambada.uberjar"
                        "-m" "myproj.core"]}}}
```

Create a simple hello world on a `-main` function at `src/myproj/core.clj`:

``` clojure
(ns myproj.core
  (:gen-class))

(defn -main [& args]
  (println "Hello World!"))
```

Of course, just for safe measure, let's run this hello world via `clj`:

``` shell
$ clj -m myproj.core
Hello World!
```

Then just call the alias from the project's root:

``` shell
$ clj -A:uberjar
Cleaning target
Creating target/classes
  Compiling myproj.core
Creating target/myproj-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Updating pom.xml
Creating target/myproj-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
  Including myproj-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
  Including clojure-1.9.0.jar
  Including spec.alpha-0.1.143.jar
  Including core.specs.alpha-0.1.24.jar
Done!
```

Once Cambada is done, you'll have two jar packages at `target/`. One for a basic
jar and one standalone with all dependencies in it. In order to run it, simply
call it:

``` shell
$ java -jar target/myproj-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
Hello World!
```

`cambada.uberjar` has exactly the same options and defaults as
`cambada.jar` (see above for more details).

## Caveats

If any of your transitive dependencies has a Maven Central dependency,
`cambada` may fail on you (investigations under way). Therefore, it is
recommended that you explicitly add your repos (Central included) to
your `deps.edn` file i.e.:

``` clojure
{:deps {...}

 :mvn/repos {"central" {:url "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/"}
             "clojars" {:url "https://repo.clojars.org/"}}}
```

## Packaging as a Native Image

By using GraalVM we now have the option of packaging everything AOT
compiled as a native image.

If you want to use this feature, make sure to [download and install
GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/).

If you are a MacOS user, GraalVM CE is available as a brew cask for Java 8 and 11:

``` shell
$ brew cask install graalvm/tap/graalvm-ce-java8
# or
$ brew cask install graalvm/tap/graalvm-ce-java11
```

GraalVM's `native-image` is a package that needs to be installed
manually with the following command (attention that `gu` is at
`$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/` if it is not on your `PATH`):

``` shell
$ gu install native-image
```

You will need to set your `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to point
to where GraalVM is installed. Alternatevely you can call
`cambada.native-image` with the argument `--graalvm-home` pointing to it.

The entry point for native image packaging is
`cambada.native-image`. Let's assume your `GRAALVM_HOME` variable is
set (if you don't, use `--graalvm-home`).

Let's start with an empty project folder:

``` shell
$ mkdir -p myproj/src/myproj/
$ cd myproj
```

Create a `deps.edn` at the root of your project with `cambada.jar` as an alias:

``` clojure
{:aliases {:native-image
           {:extra-deps
            {luchiniatwork/cambada {:mvn/version "1.0.0"}}
            :main-opts ["-m" "cambada.native-image"
                        "-m" "myproj.core"]}}}
```

Create a simple hello world on a `-main` function at `src/myproj/core.clj`:

``` clojure
(ns myproj.core
  (:gen-class))

(defn -main [& args]
  (println "Hello World!"))
```

Of course, just for safe measure, let's run this hello world via `clj`:

``` shell
$ clj -m myproj.native-image
Hello World!
```

Then just call the alias from the project's root:

``` shell
$ clj -A:native-image
Cleaning target
Creating target/classes
  Compiling myproj.core
Creating target/myproj
   classlist:   2,810.07 ms
       (cap):   1,469.31 ms
       setup:   2,561.28 ms
  (typeflow):   5,802.45 ms
   (objects):   2,644.17 ms
  (features):      40.54 ms
    analysis:   8,609.18 ms
    universe:     314.28 ms
     (parse):   1,834.84 ms
    (inline):   2,338.45 ms
   (compile):  16,824.24 ms
     compile:  21,435.77 ms
       image:   1,862.44 ms
       write:   1,276.55 ms
     [total]:  38,942.48 ms

Done!
```

Once Cambada is done, you'll have an executable package at `target/`:

``` shell
$ ./target/myproj
Hello World!
```

Extra options can be sent to GraalVM's packager by using Cambada's
`--graalvm-opt` option i.e., to include `FILE` as a resource, simply
use `--graalvm-opt H:IncludeResources=FILE`.

## Performance Comparison

A quick comparison of the `myproj` hello world as described previously and ran
across different packaging options:

Straight with `clj`:

``` shell
$ time clj -m myproj.core
Hello World!
1.160 secs
```

As a standalone uberjar:

``` shell
$ time java -jar target/myproj-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
Hello World!
0.850 secs
```

As a native image:

``` shell
$ time ./target/myproj
Hello World!
0.054 secs
```

Comparing with `clj` as a baseline:

| Method         | Speed in secs | Speed relative to `clj` |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| `clj`          | `1.160 secs`  | `1x`                    |
| `uberjar`      | `0.850 secs`  | `1.36x`                 |
| `native-image` | `0.054 secs`  | `21.48x`                |
